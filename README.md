va-isaac-gui-pa
========

Project for assembling a (branded) ISAAC application.  Use the `master` branch as a template.

To create custom branding, simply create a branch from `master` and edit the `app.properties` file in the `config` project.  Change desired properties and build va-isaac-gui-pa as usual.
